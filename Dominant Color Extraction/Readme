#Dominant Color Extraction using K-Means Clustering

This project uses K-Means Clustering to extract the most dominant colors from an image. It’s a simple yet powerful example of how unsupervised machine learning can be applied to image processing and computer vision tasks.

#Features

Upload any image and get the top N dominant colors

Visualizes the color palette using matplotlib

Can be used for color theme generation, design inspiration.

# Technologies Used

Python 
OpenCV
scikit-learn
NumPy
Matplotlib

# How It Works

The image is loaded and converted from BGR to RGB.

It is reshaped into a 2D array of pixels.

K-Means clustering is applied to group pixels into k clusters.

The cluster centers (centroids) are interpreted as dominant RGB colors.

The result is visualized as a color bar or swatches.
